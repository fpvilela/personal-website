  5. Projects
  This section is a curated homepage list of featured projects. Each item should follow a repeatable editorial structure.

  Selection guidance:
  - The homepage should feature a limited subset of projects rather than the full archive.
  - Prefer 4 featured projects for the homepage.
  - Select projects based on recency, representativeness, and strategic value.
  - Prioritize work that best demonstrates breadth across web systems, workflow automation, AI-assisted systems, integrations, and product-oriented implementation.
  - Keep the full project archive for the dedicated projects page.

  Current selection decision for this project:
  - Connecta Moveis `#connecta-moveis-website`
  - Real Estate Multi-Agent System `#real-estate-multi-agent`
  - Legal Automation `#legal-automation`
  - Communit Hub `#communit-hub`

  Reason for the current selection:
  - These four projects provide the strongest homepage overview of the current portfolio.
  - Connecta Moveis represents end-to-end web system delivery with requirements analysis, administration workflows, and deployment.
  - Real Estate Multi-Agent System highlights a more distinctive AI and multi-agent implementation.
  - Legal Automation demonstrates workflow automation, messaging, and business-facing AI integrations.
  - Communit Hub shows collaborative product work in a modern application stack.
  - Together, they give the homepage a concise but representative mix of web systems, automation, integrations, and platform development.

  - Project title: [project title]
  - Project reference: #[project-id]

    - Deployed the project to production hosting.
  - Links: [optional]

  6. Education
  This section should act as a concise credibility layer rather than a full academic history block.
  Following the Santifer pattern more closely, the section should be divided into two internal groups:
  - Education
  - Courses and Certificates

  6.1 Education
  This subgroup should contain formal academic education only.

  Structure for each education entry:
  - Period or graduation: [period or year]
  - Institution: [university name]
  - Institution link: [URL]
  - Degree title: [degree title]
  - Supporting note: [short note about specialization, emphasis, dissertation, monograph, or academic focus]
  - Location: [place] (optional)

  Example structural form:
  - 2021
  - [institution name]
  - Bachelor's in Systems Analysis and Development
  - Supporting note: [short academic note]

  6.2 Courses and Certificates
  This subgroup should contain shorter educational programs, courses, and certifications in a more compact format than formal education.

  Structure for each course or certificate entry:
  - Year or status: [year, completion state, or in-progress state]
  - Provider: [organization, school, or platform]
  - Title: [course or certificate title]
  - Supporting note: [short note about scope, completion, or relevance]
  - Links:
    - [link label] -> [URL]
    - [link label] -> [URL]

  Example structural form:
  - Completed
  - Udemy
  - CSS - The Complete Guide
  - Supporting note: Completed all coursework credits.
  - Links:
    - Official website -> [URL]
    - Tracking repository -> [URL]

  7. Skills and Languages
  This section should present the full skill inventory in a compact and scannable way.
  The recommended direction is a hybrid of the editorial grouping seen in `santifer.io` and the fuller stack visibility seen in `jrdan.dev`.
  Languages should remain as an internal subgroup instead of becoming a standalone section.
  Skills should be rendered as compact grouped blocks, ideally as chips or short inline tags inside each category, not as descriptive bullets or individual cards.
  Skills on the homepage should not show `since-year`.
  Skill competency should be shown in a lightweight way through a competency marker per skill, supported by a single legend for the section.

  Structure:
  - Section heading: Skills and Languages
  - Competency legend:
    - [marker] Beginner
    - [marker] Experienced
    - [marker] Advanced
    - [marker] Expert
  - Skill groups:
    - Group title: [category name]
    - Items:
      - [skill label] + [competency marker]
      - [skill label] + [competency marker]
      - [skill label] + [competency marker]
    - Group title: [category name]
    - Items:
      - [skill label] + [competency marker]
      - [skill label] + [competency marker]
      - [skill label] + [competency marker]
  - Languages subgroup:
    - [language]: [proficiency]
    - [language]: [proficiency]

  Example structural form:
  - Legend:
    - ○ Beginner
    - ● Experienced
    - ◆ Advanced
    - ■ Expert
  - Development: HTML ●, CSS ●, JavaScript ●, TypeScript ●, PHP ●, Python ●
  - Database: MySQL / MariaDB ●, PostgreSQL ●, Supabase ◆
  - Automation and Platforms: n8n ◆, Zapier ●, Process Automation ◆, Document Automation ◆
  - Integrations: API Integration ◆, Microsoft Graph API ●, OAuth ●, Google Apps Script ●
  - AI and Chatbots: Artificial Intelligence ◆, OpenAI API ◆, Chatbot Development ●
  - DevOps and Tools: Git ■, GitHub ■, Docker ●, Deployment ◆, SSH ◆
  - Applied Skills: Authentication ●, Requirements Analysis ●, Technical Documentation ●, Sales Pipeline Management ◆
  - Languages:
    - Portuguese: native
    - English: professional

  8. Closing Contact Block
  This section should be a compact closing block, not a large standalone contact module.

  Structure:
  - Section heading: [short closing heading]
  - Closing statement: [short invitation to contact or collaborate]
  - Contact actions:
    - [contact method label] -> [contact target]
    - [contact method label] -> [contact target]
    - [contact method label] -> [contact target]
  - Optional final CTA:
    - Label: [CTA label]
    - Target: [URL or anchor]

  Example structural form:
  - Heading: Let's connect
  - Closing statement: Available for web development, automation, and collaboration opportunities.
  - Email -> mailto:[email]
  - LinkedIn -> [profile URL]
  - GitHub -> [profile URL]

  9. Source Mapping
  This section defines how homepage content should be derived from the resume dataset so the homepage remains consistent with the resume structure.

  Mapping rules:
  - Hero content should be derived from the Professional Summary, prioritizing specialization, value, and strongest technologies.
  - About Me should reuse the Professional Summary direction, but rewrite it into a more personal and homepage-oriented tone.
  - Experience entries should be selected from Work Experience, keeping only the most relevant or recent items for homepage use.
  - Project entries should be selected from Projects, favoring the strongest and most representative work.
  - Education should be condensed from the Education section, reducing detail where necessary.
  - Skills and Languages should be derived from the Skills and Languages sections, grouped for readability instead of shown as a long flat list.
  - Closing Contact Block should be derived from Contact Information and the most relevant professional profile links.
